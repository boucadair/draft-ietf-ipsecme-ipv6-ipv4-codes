    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>As described in <xref target="RFC7849"></xref>, if the subscription
      data or network configuration allows only one IP address family (IPv4 or
      IPv6), the cellular host must not request a second PDP-Context to the
      same APN for the other IP address family (AF). The Third Generation
      Partnership Project (3GPP) network informs the cellular host about
      allowed Packet Data Protocol (PDP) types by means of Session Management
      (SM) cause codes. In particular, the following cause codes can be
      returned: <list style="symbols">
          <t>cause #50 "PDP type IPv4 only allowed": This cause code is used
          by the network to indicate that only PDP type IPv4 is allowed for
          the requested Public Data Network (PDN) connectivity.</t>

          <t>cause #51 "PDP type IPv6 only allowed": This cause code is used
          by the network to indicate that only PDP type IPv6 is allowed for
          the requested PDN connectivity.</t>

          <t>cause #52 "single address bearers only allowed": This cause code
          is used by the network to indicate that the requested PDN
          connectivity is accepted with the restriction that only single IP
          version bearers are allowed.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>If the requested IPv4v6 PDP-Context is not supported by the network
      but IPv4 and IPv6 PDP types are allowed, then the cellular host will be
      configured with an IPv4 address or an IPv6 prefix by the network. It
      must initiate another PDP-Context activation of the other address family
      in addition to the one already activated for a given Access Point Name
      (APN). The purpose of initiating a second PDP-Context is to achieve
      dual-stack connectivity by means of two PDP-Contexts.</t>

      <t>When the UE attaches the network using a WLAN access by means of
      IKEv2 capabilities <xref target="RFC7296"></xref>, there are no
      equivalent notification codes to inform the User Equipment (UE) why an
      IP address family is not assigned or whether that UE should retry with
      another address family. <!--The lack of such codes has also some effect on providing service continuity during handover events from a cellular network to WLAN, and vice versa.--></t>

      <t>This document fills that void by introducing new IKEv2 notification
      status types for the sake of deterministic UE behaviors (<xref
      target="new"></xref>).</t>

      <t>These notification status types are not specific to 3GPP
      architectures, but can be used in other deployment contexts. Cellular
      networks are provided as an illustration example.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="notation" title="Terminology">
      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
      "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
      "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14
      <xref target="RFC2119"></xref><xref target="RFC8174"></xref> when, and
      only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.</t>

      <t>This document makes use of the terms defined in <xref
      target="RFC7296"></xref>. In particular, readers should be familiar with
      "initiator" and "responder" terms used in that document.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Why Not INTERNAL_ADDRESS_FAILURE?">
      <t>The following address assignment failures may be encountered when an
      initiator requests assignment of IP addresses/prefixes:<list
          style="symbols">
          <t>An initiator asks for IPvx, but IPvx address assignment is not
          supported by the responder.</t>

          <t>An initiator requests both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, but only IPv4
          address assignment is supported by the responder.</t>

          <t>An initiator requests both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, but only IPv6
          prefix assignment is supported by the responder.</t>

          <t>An initiator asks for both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, but only one
          address family can be assigned by the responder for policy
          reasons.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t><xref target="RFC7296">Section 3.15.4 of</xref> defines a generic
      notification error type that is related to a failure to handle an
      internal address failure. That error type does not explicitly allow an
      initiator to determine why a given address family is not assigned, nor
      whether it should try using another address family.
      INTERNAL_ADDRESS_FAILURE is a catch-all error type when an
      address-related issue is encountered by an IKEv2 responder.</t>

      <t>INTERNAL_ADDRESS_FAILURE does not provide sufficient hints to the
      IKEv2 initiator to adjust its behavior.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="new" title="IP6_ALLOWED and IP4_ALLOWED Status Types">
      <t>IP6_ALLOWED and IP4_ALLOWED status types (see <xref
      target="sec-IANA"></xref>) are defined to inform the initiator about the
      responser's address family assignment support capabilities, and to
      report to the initiator the reason why an address assignment failed.
      These notification status types are used by the initiator to adjust its
      behavior accordingly (<xref target="update"></xref>).</t>

      <t>No data is associated with these notifications.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="update" title="An Update to RFC7296">
      <t>If the initiator is dual-stack, it MUST include both address families
      in its request (absent explicit policy/configuration otherwise).</t>

      <t>The responder MUST include IP6_ALLOWED and/or IP4_ALLOWED status type
      in a response to an address assignment request as indicated in <xref
      target="table"></xref>.</t>

      <t>If the initiator only receives one single notification IP4_ALLOWED or
      IP6_ALLOWED from the responder, the initiator MUST NOT send a request
      for an alternate address family not supported by the responder.</t>

      <t>If a dual-stack initiator requests only an IPv6 prefix (or an IPv4
      address) but only receives IP4_ALLOWED (or IP6_ALLOWED) notification
      status type from the responder, the initiator MUST send a request for
      IPv4 address(es) (or IPv6 prefix(es)).</t>

      <t>If a dual-stack initiator requests both an IPv6 prefix and an IPv4
      address but receives an IPv6 prefix (or an IPv4 address) only with both
      IP4_ALLOWED and IP6_ALLOWED notification status types from the
      responder, the initiator MAY send a request for the other AF (i.e., IPv4
      address (or IPv6 prefix)). In such case, the initiator MUST create a new
      IKE Security Association (SA) and request that another AF using the new
      IKE SA. </t>

      <t>For other address-related error cases that have not been covered by
      the aforementioned notification status types, the repsonder/initiator
      MUST follow the procedure defined in <xref target="RFC7849">Section
      3.15.4 of</xref>.</t>
