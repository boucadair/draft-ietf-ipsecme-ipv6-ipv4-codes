    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>As described in <xref target="RFC7849"></xref>, if the subscription
      data or network configuration allows only one IP address family (IPv4 or
      IPv6), the cellular host must not request a second PDP-Context to the
      same Access Point Name (APN) for the other IP address family (AF). The
      Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) network informs the cellular
      host about allowed Packet Data Protocol (PDP) types by means of Session
      Management (SM) cause codes. In particular, the following cause codes
      can be returned: <list style="symbols">
          <t>cause #50 "PDP type IPv4 only allowed": This cause code is used
          by the network to indicate that only PDP type IPv4 is allowed for
          the requested Public Data Network (PDN) connectivity.</t>

          <t>cause #51 "PDP type IPv6 only allowed": This cause code is used
          by the network to indicate that only PDP type IPv6 is allowed for
          the requested PDN connectivity.</t>

          <t>cause #52 "single address bearers only allowed": This cause code
          is used by the network to indicate that the requested PDN
          connectivity is accepted with the restriction that only single IP
          version bearers are allowed.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>If the requested IPv4v6 PDP-Context is not supported by the network
      but IPv4 and IPv6 PDP types are allowed, then the cellular host will be
      configured with an IPv4 address or an IPv6 prefix by the network. It
      must initiate another PDP-Context activation of the other address family
      in addition to the one already activated for a given APN. The purpose of
      initiating a second PDP-Context is to achieve dual-stack connectivity
      (that is, IPv4 and IPv6 connectivity) by means of two PDP-Contexts.</t>

      <t>When the User Equipment (UE) attaches the 3GPP network using a
      non-3GPP access network (e.g., Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN)),
      there are no equivalent Internet Key Exchange Protocol Version 2 (IKEv2)
      capabilities <xref target="RFC7296"></xref> notification codes for the
      3GPP network to inform the UE why an IP address family is not assigned
      or whether that UE should retry with another address family. </t>

      <t>This document fills that void by introducing new IKEv2 notification
      status types for the sake of deterministic UE behaviors (<xref
      target="new"></xref>).</t>

      <t>These notification status types are not specific to 3GPP
      architectures, but can be used in other deployment contexts. Cellular
      networks are provided as an illustration example.</t>

    <section anchor="notation" title="Terminology">
      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
      "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
      "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14
      <xref target="RFC2119"></xref><xref target="RFC8174"></xref> when, and
      only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.</t>

      <t>This document makes use of the terms defined in <xref
      target="RFC7296"></xref>. In particular, readers should be familiar with
      "initiator" and "responder" terms used in that document.</t>

    <section title="Why Not INTERNAL_ADDRESS_FAILURE?">
      <t>The following address assignment failures may be encountered when an
      initiator requests assignment of IP addresses/prefixes:<list
          style="symbols">
          <t>An initiator asks for IPvx, but IPvx address assignment is not
          supported by the responder.</t>

          <t>An initiator requests both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, but only IPv4
          address assignment is supported by the responder.</t>

          <t>An initiator requests both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, but only IPv6
          prefix assignment is supported by the responder.</t>

          <t>An initiator asks for both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, but only one
          address family can be assigned by the responder for policy
          reasons.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t><xref target="RFC7296">Section 3.15.4 of</xref> defines a generic
      notification error type (INTERNAL_ADDRESS_FAILURE) that is related to a
      failure to handle an address assignment request. The responder sends
      INTERNAL_ADDRESS_FAILURE only if no addresses can be assigned. This
      behavior does not explicitly allow an initiator to determine why a given
      address family is not assigned, nor whether it should try using another
      address family. INTERNAL_ADDRESS_FAILURE is a catch-all error type when
      an address-related issue is encountered by an IKEv2 responder.</t>

      <t>INTERNAL_ADDRESS_FAILURE does not provide sufficient hints to the
      IKEv2 initiator to adjust its behavior.</t>

    <section anchor="new" title="IP6_ALLOWED and IP4_ALLOWED Status Types">
      <t>IP6_ALLOWED and IP4_ALLOWED notification status types (see <xref
      target="sec-IANA"></xref>) are defined to inform the initiator about the
      responder's address family assignment support capabilities, and to
      report to the initiator the reason why an address assignment failed.
      These notification status types are used by the initiator to adjust its
      behavior accordingly (<xref target="update"></xref>).</t>

      <t>No data is associated with these notifications.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="update" title="An Update to RFC7296">
      <t>If the initiator is dual-stack (i.e., supports both IPv4 and IPv6),
      it MUST include both address families configuration attributes in its
      configuration request (absent explicit policy/configuration otherwise).
      More details about IPv4 and IPv6 configuration attributes are provided
      in Section 3.15 of <xref target="RFC7296"></xref>. These attributes are
      used to infer the requested/assigned AFs listed in Table 1.</t>

      <t>The responder MUST include IP6_ALLOWED and/or IP4_ALLOWED
      notification status type in a response to an address assignment request
      as indicated in Table 1. <figure>

      <t>If the initiator only receives one single notification IP4_ALLOWED or
      IP6_ALLOWED from the responder, the initiator MUST NOT send a subsequent
      request for an alternate address family not supported by the
      responder.</t>

      <t>If a dual-stack initiator requests only an IPv6 prefix (or an IPv4
      address) but only receives IP4_ALLOWED (or IP6_ALLOWED) notification
      status type from the responder, the initiator MUST send a request for
      IPv4 address(es) (or IPv6 prefix(es)).</t>

      <t>If a dual-stack initiator requests both an IPv6 prefix and an IPv4
      address but receives an IPv6 prefix (or an IPv4 address) only with both
      IP4_ALLOWED and IP6_ALLOWED notification status types from the
      responder, the initiator MAY send a request for the other AF (i.e., IPv4
      address (or IPv6 prefix)). In such case, the initiator MUST create a new
      IKE Security Association (SA) and request that another address family
      using the new IKE SA.</t>

      <t>For other address-related error cases that have not been covered by
      the aforementioned notification status types, the responder/initiator
